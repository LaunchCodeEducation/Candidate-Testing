# Candidate Testing

## Assignment Requirements

For this assignment, you are tasked with creating a quiz program that
meets each of the following conditions:

1. Use arrays to store 5 quiz questions, the correct answers, and the candidate's answers,
1. Presents each question to a "candidate" and prompts them for a response,
1. Does NOT consider case when checking answers,
1. Includes at least one loop and one conditional,
1. Uses at least one template literal,
1. Calculates the candidate's score as a percentage,
1. Correctly accepts or rejects a candidate based on their percentage.

## How Your Assignment is Graded

### Grading Tests

Provided with the assignment starter code is a suite of tests called unit tests. These are just a starting point for your TA to assess the viability of your solution and give you feedback as quickly as possible.
If you would like to run these tests yourself, run the following command inside the submitted repl: `npm test`.
For this assignment, a passing assignmnet will have an output of: 17 specs, 0 failures.
If you believe that your work meets all the requirements for the assignment and you are getting some test failures, don't hesitate to reach out to your TA for assistance!

### Beyond the Tests

The tests aren't the only way your TA will grade your work.
They will be looking for other things as well. 

1. When they run your code, does the output look like the [example output](https://education.launchcode.org/intro-to-professional-web-dev/assignments/candidateQuiz.html#example-output) in the textbook?
1. Does your code include the following?
   a. Arrays
   b. At least one template literal
   c. A loop

Your TA will also run your code with several answer sets to check the program's accuracy. Here is one for you to use!

"trUE", "40", "trajectory", "Sally Ride", "3". These answers should produce a grade of 100% and a status of "passed".

When you are ready, submit the link to your repl in Canvas.
